# NeatoTags
A GameObject Tagging System for Unity.


A GameObject Tagging System using ScriptableObjects. Multiple tags per GameObject and various functions for querying GameObjects with tags. 
No need for a singleton Tag Manager or the use of GetComponent! Just need the GameObject you want to query and a reference to the tag(s) you are interested in. 
Neato Tags have a color and comment property.

I don't know about you but I'd say that's pretty neat!
